# vaccination-sentiment-analysis-over-time
Code Run on Google Colab for the MIS 441 final project. The project was focused on creating an ULMFiT sentiment classification model to understand the changes in sentiment over time. Much of the code was borrowed and adapted from Tom Whelan, who wrote a much more comprehensive sentiment analysis, please check it out here (https://www.kaggle.com/twhelan/covid-19-vaccine-sentiment-analysis-with-fastai/notebook). After failing to find a statistically significant difference in sentiment over time, overall and for specific brands, my group focused on researching the reactionary nature of the sentiment and the impact of political polarization on the subject.
